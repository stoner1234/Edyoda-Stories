            <p>The last couple of years zekeLabs gave me a unique opportunity to assess technology demand in the
                industry and also to evaluate available talent pool for the demand.

                Our consulting and technology training assignments for our corporate partners enlightened us on the
                technology skill in demand. We discovered - What, Where and which technologies are increasingly being
                adopted by the Industry.

                Our interaction with the engineering graduates and IT professionals during the technology workshops,
                seminars and our technology skilling initiatives, We found out the current tech skill-sets of the
                millennial generation and the skill gap.</p>
